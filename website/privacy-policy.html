        </li>
        <li>Use of Information:
            The information collected by the "aww" bot is used solely to perform its intended function, which is to pull

        </li>
        <li>Security:
            The "aww" bot is hosted on Cloudflare servers, which have security measures in place to protect against
            unauthorized access and data breaches. The collected information is stored securely and accessed only by
            authorized personnel who require the information to perform their duties related to the "aww" bot.</li>
        <li>Third-Party Services:
            The "aww" bot may use third-party services, such as Reddit API, to fetch pet pictures from r/aww subreddit.
            These services may collect and store additional information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
            However, the "aww" bot does not have control over these services and is not responsible for their data
            collection practices.</li>

        <li>Changes to the Privacy Policy:
            The "aww" bot owner reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Users will be notified of
            any changes via the Discord server where the bot is installed.</li>
        <li>User Data Retention:
            The "aww" bot will retain user data only for as long as necessary to perform its intended function. Once the

            The "aww" bot owner will not be liable for any damages resulting from the use of the bot or the information
            collected by it. The bot is provided as-is, without any warranty of any kind, express or implied.</li>
        <li>Jurisdiction and Governing Law:
